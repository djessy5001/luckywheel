Have you ever wanted to reward your players for being active with random loots? LuckyWheel is the solution!!

### Description:

LuckyWheel is a spigot plugin that enables the players of the server to spin a wheel
that gives them a random item.

The LootTables of the LuckyWheel are customizable! You can:

- Change the items
- Modify the probability of dropping said item
- Change the cooldown for spinning the wheel
- Create new LootTables and erase them

You can also change the language of the plugin to spanish (es), simplified chinese (zhcn) or french (fr), by going to
the config.yml and changing

`locale: en`

with

`locale: es`

### Commands:

`/lw`: The main command. Shows a GUI with the LootTable and allows the user to spin the wheel.

`/lw create <name>`: Create a new LootTable with name `<name>` (requires permission `luckywheel.loottables.edit`)

### Permissions:

`luckywheel.loottables.edit`: Enable the user to edit the LootTables (default admin)

`luckywheel.loottables.bypass_cooldown`: Enables the user to bypass the LootTables cooldown (default none)

### Cooldown:

cooldown time.

- FULL_DAY - Every 24 hours
